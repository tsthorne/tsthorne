# README

## Introduction

Hi I'm Tom, and I'm an Electronics Engineer, exploring a career change in to DevOps.

I'm using this space to practice a bit of everything, this includes:

1. :snake: Python
2. :whale: Docker
3. :wheel_of_dharma: Kubernetes
4. :infinity: Jenkins
5. :mountain: Terraform
6. :cloud: AWS
7. :computer: Linux

And how could I forget!?

8. :octocat: GIT! 

Here's to learning new skills, which I'm hoping to verify by obtaining their respective Certifications.

Cheers üçª
